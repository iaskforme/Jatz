# Jatz

Jatz is the project I presented for my final dissertation at my school. In short terms is an Android note taking app based on **Scrum**
and apps like [Trello](https://trello.com/) or [Evernote](https://evernote.com/intl/es).

It is developed with Kotlin and the common XML. My Backend is managed by [Parse Server](https://parseplatform.org/) which may not work
right now because it was the free trial version (deffinetly recommended for not long projects and demos).

Aside from the project you can take a look at th file *Jatz - Jordi Ortegon.pdf* that has full documentation (ufortunately in spanish) 
of how every part of the app works.
